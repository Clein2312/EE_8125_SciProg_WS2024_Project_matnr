# EE_8125_SciProg_WS2024-2025_Project_matnr

## General Infos

This small project with three exercises is part of the Scientific Programming Assignment in the winter semester of 2024-2025. Each exercise will be graded for a maximum of 10 points.

1. Due date is **2025-02-28**.
1. The delivery of the assignment is individual and not in groups.
1. **Download** (not clone) this git repo, **really unzip** it (right click, extract, ...) and **rename the unpacked folder according to your matriculation number**, e.g. rename `EE_8125_SciProg_WS2024_Project_matnr` to `EE_8125_SciProg_WS2024_Project_18637`, if your matriculation number is `18637`. 
1. Enter your **matriculation numbers** into the **headers of each Jupyter notebook.**
1. **Edit the provided Jupyter notebooks** containing the exercises and answer the questions directly in them. Add additional code and markdown cells as needed. It is not necessary to create new notebooks!
1. **Do not use pocket calculators or spreadsheet programs!** Do all your calculations explicitly in the Jupyter notebooks! Otherwise we will deduct points for this. 
1. Just providing code is not enough! **Describe shortly** what you are doing! Use **markdown cells** with **appropriate formatting** (headers, lists, typesetting of equations, etc.) in your Jupyter Notebooks to explain your steps. Use short comments in your code cells, too.
1. After you have completed the tasks, zip the directory with your code and data and [**upload the zip file to Moodle**](https://moodle.hochschule-rhein-waal.de/mod/assign/view.php?id=498109).
